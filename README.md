# [Color My Keyboard](https://colormykeyboard.xyz)
A Firebase web app that controls the individual RGB lights on my keyboard.

## How it works
Every key color is stored in a Firestore DB, and any color changes made on the website update the DB.

I created a [NodeJS app](https://github.com/kumpmati/online-rgb-keyboard) on my PC to create a custom SteelSeries GameSense app that syncs the colors in realtime.
